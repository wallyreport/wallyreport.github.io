Special Equipment Needed
- a stand mixer is very handy for this, but a hand mixer will do
- loaf pan, 5×9 inch

## Ingredients
- 3 large or extra large eggs
- 1/4 C (60ml) vegetable oil
- 1 tsp vinegar
- 1 1/4 C (295ml) warm but not hot water
- 1 TBL sugar
- 3 TBL honey (or molasses, or more sugar)
- 1 1/2 TBL active yeast (I use Red Star)
- 1 C (120g) tapioca starch/flour (they are the same thing)
- 3 C (400g) other gluten free flour–this is where you can play w/whole grain gf flours:
-    -I often use 1 C (155g) brown rice flour, 1 C (105g) amaranth flour, 1 C (140g) sorghum flour
- 2/3 C (60g) instant dry milk powder (or you can substitute sweet rice flour)
- 2 tsp xanthan gum
- 1 tsp salt
- Optional: 2 TBL flax seeds, or gf oats, or sunflower seeds
- extra oil and tapioca flour for pan

## Directions
- If you can, it’s very helpful to bring all the refrigerated ingredients to room temperature.
- Oil and flour your pan.
- In a small bowl or a glass measuring cup, whisk 1 TBL sugar into warm water until dissolved, add yeast and whisk until dissolved; set aside to proof (get foamy)
- In a medium bowl, mix all 4 of your flours your flours.  Add dry milk powder (or sweet rice flour), xanthan gum, salt, and remaining sugar if using, as well as the seeds/flax/oats if using.
- In the bowl of stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat eggs slightly.  Add honey or molasses if using, vinegar, and oil, beat slightly to combine.  Add yeast mixture, beat slightly to combine.  Add flour mixture, beat on low to combine and then beat on high for about 3 minutes.
- Scrape into prepared pan and smooth top with a spatula.
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
- You may put pan with dough on top of stove so it can use the heat of the oven to help it rise.  Let rise until double in bulk, about 45 minutes.
- When ready to bake, use a pastry brush to brush top of bread with a little extra oil or melted butter.
- Bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.  Loosely tent with aluminum foil and bake another 30 minutes (40 minutes total).
- Remove bread from oven and let cool for about 5 minutes in the pan, then carefully turn out onto cooling rack to cool completely.
- We usually eat this within a couple of days, so it lives on the cutting board in the kitchen, cut-side down. Store at room temperature–not in the refrigerator!
