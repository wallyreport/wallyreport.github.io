# VEGAN NO-CHURN CHOCOLATE COCONUT BANANA ICE CREAM


### INGREDIENTS
- 2 med.-lg. frozen bananas
- 1 can full-fat coconut milk
- 1/2 cup pitted dates
- Scant 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- Pinch of salt
- Mint, for garnish
- Peanuts, to top
- Any other desired toppings (choc. chips, nuts, raisins, fresh fruit, etc.)


### INSTRUCTIONS
- Place bananas, coconut milk, dates, cocoa powder and a pinch of salt in a high-speed blender. 
- Blend until smooth.
- Transfer to a container and freeze for three hours, or until mixture turns into a creamy-cool ice cream.
- Enjoy after three hours in the freezer for a soft-serve-like consistency. If you leave it in there much longer, then you'll want to sit it out for a few minutes before serving.
