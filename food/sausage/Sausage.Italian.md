# Sausage Italian Vegan GF.md



## INGREDIENTS

### For the Spice Mix:
- 1 ½ tsp. garlic powder
- 1 ½ tsp. fennel, crushed
- ½ tsp. black pepper
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1 ½ tsp. sweet paprika
- 1 ½ tsp. smoked paprika
- ½ tsp. red pepper flakes
- 1 tsp. oregano
- 1/8 tsp. allspice

### For the Sausage:
- 2 tsp. + 2 tsp. olive oil
- 1 cup mushrooms, chopped
- ¼ cup onion, finely chopped
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 2 cups cooked or 1-15 oz. can of black-eyed peas, drained and rinsed
- 1 Tbs. sun-dried tomato paste
- ¼ cup nutritional yeast
- ½ cup brown rice flour
- 1 tsp. xanthan gum
- 3 Tbs. of gluten-free, vegan Worcestershire Sauce
- A few drops of Liquid Smoke (optional)


## DIRECTIONS

- Heat a skillet with 2 tsp. of olive oil. Sauté the onions, mushrooms and garlic until softened. Set aside and let cool.
- In a large bowl, add the black-eyed peas and mash them up. You can use a fork, a potato masher or just get your hands in there. If you want to use a food processor, do a rough chop. You don’t want a puree. Then add the tomato paste, nutritional yeast, spice mix and brown rice flour. Mix well.
- Sprinkle the xanthan gum over the mixture and incorporate it well.
- Add the cooled veggie mixture to the bowl and mix it into the dry ingredients. Add the Worcestershire sauce to the bowl and mix it all up well. If you are using the Liquid Smoke, add it in now too, along with the remaining 2 tsp. of oil.

- Divide the mixture into 4 parts. Shape each part into a log. Wrap the logs individually in foil and steam them for 15-20 minutes. I use a metal steamer that sits atop a large stockpot of boiling water. Let them cool. Then refrigerate for a few hours or overnight, if possible. This will help them firm up even more.

- When ready to use, unwrap and cook them however you desire. We cooked them on a grill pan and topped them with mustard and sautéed bell peppers and onions. Yum!
