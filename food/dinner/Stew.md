### INGREDINETS:
- 1½ large yellow or white onions, chopped
- 3 ribs celery, chopped
- 3 medium carrots, chopped
- 2 portabella mushrooms (about ½ pound), chopped
- 1½ tablespoon finely chopped garlic (5 to 6 cloves)
- 5 cups water
- 2 pounds potatoes (~3 large Yukon Gold or sweet potatoes/ yams), chopped
- ¼ cup salt-free tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon salt-free Italian herb blend
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary
- 1½ cups green peas (if frozen, thaw first)
- ½ cup fresh parsley leaves, chopped
- Ground black pepper, to taste


### METHOD:
1. Heat a large soup pot on high with 1 tablespoon of water. When the water begins to sputter, add the onion, celery, and carrot, and cook for 7 to 8 minutes, stirring frequently as the edges of the onion browns slightly, and adding a little water as needed to prevent sticking.
2. Stir in the mushrooms and garlic, and continue to cook while stirring for an additional 5 minutes, adding water as needed.
3. Add the 5 cups of water, potatoes, tomato paste, dried Italian herbs, and paprika. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to a low boil. Stir in the rosemary and cook covered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Add the peas, and cook for 5 minutes more, or until the carrots and potatoes are tender.
5. Place 2 cups of the stew (broth and vegetables) into a blender, and blend under very smooth. Stir this back into the pot to thicken the stew, and stir in the parsley. Serve with ground black pepper and, if you like, add a small sprig of rosemary as garnish.
