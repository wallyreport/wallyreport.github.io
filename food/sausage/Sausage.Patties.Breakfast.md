### For the Spice Mix

- 1 tsp. garlic powder
- 1 tsp. fennel, crushed
- ½ tsp. black pepper
- 2 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. smoked paprika
- ½ tsp. red pepper flakes
- 1 tsp. dried sage
- 1 tsp. onion powder
- 1 tsp. dried thyme
- 1 Tbs. sugar
- ½ tsp. nutmeg

### For the Sausage

- 2 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 cup mushrooms, chopped
- ¼ cup onion, finely chopped
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 2 cups cooked or 1-15 oz. can of black-eyed peas, drained and rinsed
- 1 Tbs. tomato paste
- ¼ cup nutritional yeast
- ½ cup brown rice flour
- 1 Tbs. of gluten-free, vegan Worcestershire Sauce
- A few drops of liquid smoke (optional)
- 2 Tbs. maple syrup (optional)
- 1 Tbs. canola oil

### Preparation

- Prepare spice mix in advance. Set aside.
- Heat a skillet with 2 tsp. of olive oil. Sauté the onions, mushrooms and garlic until softened. Set aside and let cool.
- In a large bowl, add the black-eyed peas and mash them up. You can use a fork, a potato masher or just get your hands in there. If you want to use a food processor, do a rough chop. You don’t want a puree. Then add the tomato paste, nutritional yeast, spice mix and brown rice flour. Mix well..
- Add the cooled veggie mixture to the bowl and mix it into the dry ingredients. Add the Worcestershire sauce to the bowl and mix it all up well. If you are using the Liquid Smoke, add it in now too. If you are using the maple syrup, add it now. If you do use it, you may need to add more flour to compensate for the extra moisture.
- Refrigerate the sausage mixture for at least 30 minutes. After that time, remove from the fridge. Divide the mixture into 4 parts. Shape each part into a patty.
- Heat 1 Tbs. of canola oil in a cast iron skillet. Cook the sausage until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Serve while hot.
