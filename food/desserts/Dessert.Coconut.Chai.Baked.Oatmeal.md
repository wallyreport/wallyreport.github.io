# Coconut Chai Baked Oatmeal

### INGREDIENTS
- Oatmeal
- 2 flax eggs ( 2 tablespoons flax meal + 5 tablespoons filtered water)
- 1 ½ cups filtered water, room temp
- 1 ¼ cups unsweetened coconut milk, room temp (sub almond milk)
- ¼ cup maple syrup (sub honey if not vegan or apple juice syrup - recipe here)
- 3 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups gluten free oats
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cardamom
- ⅛ teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon cloves
- ¾ teaspoon ginger
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- Toppings (optional)
- Coconut whipped cream
- Toasted unsweetened coconut flakes
- Fruit

### INSTRUCTIONS
- Preheat oven to 350 and grease a 8 by 8 baking dish with coconut oil (or olive oil).
- While the oven is preheating, make chai spice mix by combining all spices in a small dish. Set aside.
- Prepare flax eggs in a medium sized mixing bowl and let sit for 3-5 minutes.
- To the flax eggs, add 1 ½ cups filtered water (room temp), 1 ¼ cups coconut milk (room temp), 1 teaspoon vanilla, ¼ cup maple syrup, and 3 tablespoons melted coconut oil. Stir to combine.
- Then, add 3 cups gluten free oats, the chai spice mix you made, and ¼ teaspoon salt. Mix until fully incorporated.
- Pour oatmeal into prepared baking dish and spread evenly. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until all the liquid has absorbed and the middle is firm to the touch.
- Then, turn your oven to broil and bake another 5-7 minutes to crisp the edges and brown the top.
- Let cool 5 or so minutes, then serve warm with coconut milk/coconut whip cream and toasted coconut flakes, or any other desired toppings. Best when fresh but leftovers will keep in the fridge for 3-5 days. Reheat in the oven at 350 degrees or for about a minute in the microwave.
- Enjoy!
