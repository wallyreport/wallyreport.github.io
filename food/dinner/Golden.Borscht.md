# Golden Borscht

### Ingredients
- 4 cups fresh golden beets, sliced 
- 1/2 cup savoy cabbage, chopped 
- 3 small potatoes, halved and sliced 
- 1 medium carrot, sliced 
- 2 medium tomatoes, chopped 
- 2 small shallots, chopped 
- 13 oz top sirloin, or round steak cut into 1/2 inch cubes 
- 3 T fresh dill, minced 
- 3 T olive oil 
- 2 garlic cloves, minced 
- 1 T white vinegar 
- 4 cups water 
- 2 T butter 
- Salt and pepper

### Instructions
1. In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium high heat until just 
smoking, but not quite. (I know recipes always say things like this, and it is completely frustrating. 
"How do I know when something is about to start smoking before it does?" you ask. The easiest 
way is to tilt the pan from sided to side and watch the oil. Smooth oil indicates cool temperatures, when the oil ripples across the bottom of the pan it is good and hot.) Add half of the beef and sear 
on all sides. Season with salt and pepper and sear until browned. Remove and set aside. Repeat 
with remaining beef. 
2. The bottom of your pan will have browned bits, the fond, glazed on, don't scrape it just yet. Add the
garlic and shallots and lower to medium heat. Saute for 5-6 minutes, until the shallots have 
become translucent and then began to brown lightly. The well browned shallots and garlic create 
the depth of the stock. Return beef and any resting juices to the pan. Add water and dill, scrape the
bottom of the pan to release the fond into the stock. Bring to a boil and simmer until beef is tender, 
about one hour. 
3. When beef has cooked for about 35 minutes, in a medium saute pan add 2 tablespoons butter over
medium-high heat. Sauté beets, season with salt and pepper, add vinegar and tomatoes, cover to 
simmer for 15 minutes. Add carrots and sauté covered until tender, about another ten minutes. Add
cabbage to beef and stock and simmer while carrots are cooking. When carrot and beets are 
tender add to beef and mix in. Season with salt and pepper to taste if necessary. Serve with a 
dollop of sour cream, if desired, and a slice of thick rye bread. 
4. This soup get's better each day. Definitely let it sit for a day and reheat some. As the flavors blend 
together it becomes more rounded and full. Enjoy!
