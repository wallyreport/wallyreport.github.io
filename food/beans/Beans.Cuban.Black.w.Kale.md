Serves 4 as a main dish, 8 as a side dish
 
### Ingredients
- low sodium vegetable broth, a few Tbsp
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 Tbsp grated fresh ginger (using a microplaner if you have one)
- 2 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 2 15 ounce cans black beans, undrained
- 4 cups finely chopped kale or other greens
- 2 Tbsp fresh lemon or lime juice (whatever you have on hand)
- optional: hot sauce, to taste


### Directions 
- Place a medium pot over medium-high heat and coat the bottom of the pot with low sodium vegetable broth. When broth is boiling add onion and stir. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
- Lower heat to medium. Add garlic and ginger. Cook until onions are translucent, stirring frequently and adding more broth if necessary to prevent burning.
- Add chili powder, cumin, paprika and cinnamon. Stir.
- Add undrained black beans and stir. Mash with the back of a fork or a potato masher, leaving some of the beans whole.
- Add kale and stir. Lower heat to low and let simmer until mixture thickens. Stir in lime or lemon juice and hot sauce (optional) to taste. Cover until ready to serve.
