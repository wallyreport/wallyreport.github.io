Low carb, glutten free, no butter

I tried a lot of different variations of low-carb banana bread before settling on this one. Many recipes on the net use coconut flour for all or part of the flour. I did like the texture using coconut flour part of the flour -- at first. The problem was that coconut flour tends to zap moisture from the air, and the bread tended to get sodden after 2 or 3 days (this could be slowed down by putting it in the refrigerator, but freezing it didn't seem to help). So I went to my old standby -- almond meal.

The other obvious problem is that bananas are a high-sugar fruit. Some recipes use banana flavoring, but I'm not a fan. So although this recipe probably would not work for someone on a very-low-carb diet, at just 6 grams of net carb per slice, it is a lot lower in carbs than regular banana bread.
Yield: 12 slices

#### Wet Ingredients:
- 2 medium bananas, very ripe
- 3 eggs
- 2 tablespoons oil
- water
- zero-carb sugar substitute to equal 1/2 cup sugar
    - (6 tsp stevia. maybe 1/4 cup xylitol and 3 tsp stevia?) 

#### Dry Ingredients:
- 2 cups almond meal
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

#### Preparation:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Butter a loaf pan (I used the clay type)
3. If you have a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, use it, as this makes it easier to measure the wet ingredients.
4. Roughly mash the bananas, and put in 2-cup measuring cup. The banana should be about a cup, but the exact measurement isn't important. The main thing is that all the wet ingredients together will total 2 cups.
5. Add eggs and oil to cup. If you are using liquid sweetener, put that in as well. Then finish filling the cup to the 2-cup line with water. (If you only have a 1-cup measuring cup, just divide it up.)
6. Put almond meal, baking powder, and salt in bowl (and powdered sweetener if you are using it) and stir to combine.
7. Add wet ingredients, and beat for 2-3 minutes. Stir in walnuts if you are adding them.
8. Pour batter into loaf pan and smooth the top. Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
9. Cool for 10-15 minutes, and remove from pan. Cool completely before slicing.
