# Sausage Italian or Breakfest TVP  


### Ingredients
- 1 medium potato, about 8-ounces
- 3/4 cup TVP
- 1 teaspoon ground fennel
- 1 teaspoon sage
- 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke
- 2 tablespoons tamari
- 1 teaspoons red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1⁄4 teaspoon thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- 3 tablespoons tamari
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon molasses
- For Italian: 2 cloves garlic & 2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- For Breakfest:  1⁄4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 3/4 cup boiling water (I used water left over from steaming the potatoes)
- 2 tablespoons chickpea flour





### Instructions
- Peel potato and dice into 1/2-inch pieces. 
- Steam until tender, about 10 minutes. 
- Transfer to a bowl and mash very well with a potato masher (lumps of potato will make these crumble.)
- Combine everything - except potatos and chickpea flour - in a bowl
- Pour boiling water over the top. (I used water left over from steaming the potato.) 
- Set aside for 5 minutes so that the tvp will absorb the water.
- Oil a baking sheet. Preheat oven to 375 F.
- Stir the mashed potato and chickpea flour into the TVP. 
- Turn the mixture out onto a cutting board and press to about 1/2-inch thickness. 
- Use a 2-1/2-inch biscuit cutter to cut sausages. 
- Carefully transfer to the baking sheet and repeat with remaining sausage dough.
- Bake for 20 minutes, turning over after 10 minutes.
