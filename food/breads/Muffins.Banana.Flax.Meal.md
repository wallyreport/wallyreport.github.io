### Notes
Flax Seeds contain the essential fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and plant lignans, which are fiber compounds that bind to hormone receptors (estrogen and testosterone) helping to support healthy hormone balance in both men and women. Flax lignans increase the production of sex hormone-binding globulin which helps escort excess estrogen from the body. Due to their high fiber content, ground flax seeds have also been shown to support healthy cholesterol levels and healthy gastrointestinal function.
