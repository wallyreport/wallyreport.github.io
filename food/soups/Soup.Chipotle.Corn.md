# Soup Chipotle Corn 

http://www.chow.com/recipes/28537-chipotle-corn-soup

There’s no better way to celebrate summer than with this silky, slightly smoky corn soup. Chipotle chiles help balance the sweet corn for a satisfying vegetarian soup you can serve hot or cold. Meat-lovers can add a little crumbled bacon on top.

Game plan: This soup can be frozen for up to 2 weeks in an airtight container. Freeze the reserved 1/2 cup of corn kernels separately. Defrost both the soup and the kernels in the refrigerator. Purée the soup in a blender to emulsify. Rewarm it if desired, then stir in the corn kernels and garnish with scallions.

### INGREDIENTS
- 8 ears white or yellow corn, shucked
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/4 stick)
- 1/2 teaspoon minced chipotles in adobo sauce
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 6 scallions, thinly sliced (white and light green parts only)
- 1 1/2 cups whole milk
- 1 1/2 cups water

### INSTRUCTIONS

Remove the corn kernels from the cobs: Place a large container on a damp towel. Fold a paper towel into fourths and place it inside the container. Stand one ear of corn on the paper towel, using the stem as a handle. Using a paring knife, slice downward, letting the kernels fall into the container. Rotate the cob and continue until all the kernels have been removed; discard the cob. Repeat with the remaining corn (you should have about 6 cups of kernels). Discard the paper towel. Set aside 1/2 cup of the kernels.

Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until foaming. Add the chipotles, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, a pinch of black pepper, and about two-thirds of the scallions. (Set aside the remaining scallions to use as a garnish.) Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened, about 3 minutes.

Add the corn kernels, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, milk, and water and stir to combine. Increase the heat to medium high and bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the flavors have melded and the corn kernels are crisp yet tender (not mushy), about 15 minutes.

Set a fine-mesh strainer over a large, heatproof bowl. Using a blender, purée the soup in batches until smooth, removing the small cap from the blender lid (the pour lid) and covering the space with a kitchen towel (this allows steam from the hot soup to escape and prevents the blender lid from popping off). Pour the blended soup through the strainer, pressing on the solids with a rubber spatula; discard the solids.

Stir in the reserved 1/2 cup corn kernels. Season with salt and pepper as needed. If serving chilled, refrigerate the soup until cold, at least 3 hours. Garnish with the remaining scallions and serve.
