- 2 tbsp butter

### Directions:
1. Cream together butter and sugar, then beat in extracts with the egg and egg white. 
2. Add Pamela's Baking & Pancake Mix with almonds and combine.
3. On a greased cookie sheet, form a log 3-inch wide log the length of the cookie sheet. Make sure log is about 2-inches from the edge of the pan, as dough will spread when baking. Bake in a preheated 325° oven for 35 minutes. Remove the biscotti and turn down oven to 300°.
4. When loaf is cool, slice in 1/2-inch slices with a serrated knife. Lay pieces on their sides and re-bake for 25-30 minutes in 300° oven.
