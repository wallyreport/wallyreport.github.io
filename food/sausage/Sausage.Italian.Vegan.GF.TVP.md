# Sausage Italian Vegan GF TVP.md


## INGREDIENTS

### Dry:
- 1 cup TVP (Textured Veg. Protein)
- 1/2 cup nutritional yeast flakes
- 1/4 cup sorghum flour
- 1/2 tsp xanthan gum
- 2 tbsp vegetarian chicken bouillon
- 2 tbsp granulated onion
- 1 to 2 tbsp fennel seed, optional
- 2 tsp coarsely ground pepper, preferably freshly ground
- 2 tsp ground paprika
- 1 tsp dried chili flakes, optional or 1/2 if you can’t handle heat
- 1 tsp ground smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- 1/8 tsp ground allspice (didn’t have and used Italian seasonings)
- 1/2 tsp salt

### Wet:
- 1 cup water
- 6 to 8 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
- 2 tbsp olive oil


## DIRECTIONS

- Mix all of the dry ingredients well in a medium sized bowl.
- Add wet ingredients and let sit for 5 minutes so TVP can absorb moisture. Form dough into patties or sausages.
- Heat oil in a frying pan (enough so that the patties can ‘fry’)
- Cook for around 3 to 4 minutes each side or until they are nicely browned and crispy.
- Sauerkraut, Veganaise and Dijon and Deli mustard, melted Daiya cheese on a toasted bun… can’t go wrong. So good!
