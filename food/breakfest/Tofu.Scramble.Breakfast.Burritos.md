# Tofu Scramble Breakfast Burritos

### Ingredients
- 1/2 red onion (or 1/2 cup, finely chopped)
- 1/4 red bell pepper (or 1/4 cup, finely chopped )
- 1 clove garlic (minced)
- 14oz extra firm tofu (or one block)
- 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil (divided)
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast flakes
- 2 tablespoons McKay's vegan chicken style seasoning
- 1/8 teaspoon turmeric
- salt to taste

### Directions
1. Place your chopped onion, bell pepper, and garlic in a skillet/frying pan with about 1 teaspoon of olive oil and saute it on the stove on medium-high heat. 
2. Remove from heat when your onions are beginning to change color. Set the whole thing aside.
3. In a bowl (or save a dish and do it right into your pan)m crumble your tofu and mix in your seasonings. If you like your tofu cubed rather than crunbled, you could totally do that for this recipe as well. 
4. Pour 1 teaspoon of olive oil on the bottom of a frying pan/skillet and place on your stove on medium to medium-high heat. 
5. Dump your tofu on top of your olive oil, and give it a little stir. 
Continue stirring every minute or so until your tofu begins to get firm-ish around the edges Really, though, you can call it "done"
6. Gently fold your onion/pepper mixture into your tofu.
