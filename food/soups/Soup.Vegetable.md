.

### Recipe Notes

- I used the liquid from the canned beans because I find it results in a richer broth, but if you prefer to use water or vegetable broth, drain the beans, measure the liquid, and replace it with water or broth.
- The slowest part of Instant Pot cooking is waiting for the pot to reach high pressure. Thawing the vegetables beforehand or using fresh rather than frozen will shorten the cooking time.
- Finally, it's easy to make this soup on the stove, but you should start with 4 cups of water and add more as necessary because more water evaporates in stove-top cooking.
- This makes 6 average sized servings (about a cup and a half) or 4 meal-sized servings (about 2 1/2 cups each).
