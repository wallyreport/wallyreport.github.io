# Jeannes Gluten-Free Pancacks

## Wet Ingredients
- 1 large or extra large eggs, lighten beaten
- 1 1/2 TBL melted butter
- 1/2 C milk

## Dry Ingredients
- 3/4 C Jeanneâ€™s Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour Mix 
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking powder

## Instuctions
1. Mix together dry ingredients in small bowl.
2. Mix together wet ingredients in a larger bowl.
3. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients, mixing until just blended. The batter should be kind of lumpy. This means there are small pockets of flour that will burst into air pockets in the finished pancakes.
