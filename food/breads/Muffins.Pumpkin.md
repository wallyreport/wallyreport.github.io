### Dry Ingredients

- 1 1/3 cups brown rice flour (you can also use white rice flour)
- 1/4 cup buckwheat flour
- 1/2 cup potato starch
- 1/4 cup tapioca starch
- 2 teaspoons xanthan gum (or guar gum for corn-free)
- 2 teaspoons gluten free baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon Celtic sea salt
- 2/3 cup coconut sugar

### Wet Ingredients

- 1 (15oz/425g) can unsweetened pumpkin puree
- 1/2 cup grapeseed oil or coconut oil
- 1/2 cup pure maple syrup
- 1/4 cup filtered water
- 1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract


### Directions

- Preheat your oven to 325oF/160oC.
- Lightly grease and flour (I used a little brown rice flour) 4 mini-loaf tins.
- In a medium-sized bowl, combine the flours, starches, xanthan, baking powder, baking soda, spices, and salt. Set aside.
- In your stand mixer bowl, combine the sugar, pumpkin, oil, maple syrup, water, and vanilla and mix on a low speed until combined.
- Slowly add the flour mixture until all is just combined. (This happens quickly.)
- Divide the batter between your prepared tins, smoothing out the tops with the back of a spoon or spatula, since it will be a little thick.
- Bake the bread for 45 to 55 minutes, or until firm to the touch. (The bread should pull slightly away from the pan when done, and will be lightly browned.)
- Let the loaves cool for 10 minutes, before popping them out to cool completely on a wire rack. (Resist the urge to cut into these loaves while still hot. Like any bread, they will be a bit crumbly when hot, but firm up perfectly as they cool.)
