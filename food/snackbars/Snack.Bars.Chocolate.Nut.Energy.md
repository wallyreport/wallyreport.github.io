# Chocolate Nut Energy Bars adapted from Healthy Indulgences

The Results: I think I’m in love! The flavours of the nuts, seeds, coconut and vanilla all come together beautifully, and the chocolate ganache is the icing on the cake (or the bar, in this case). The bar itself is slightly crunchy and slightly chewy at the same time, and it makes for an incredibly satisfying snack. They are also nutrient-packed and big enough to keep me full for a good long time. And at 11g of carbs and 5g of fiber, they beat the pants off most other low carb energy bars in terms of their effect on my blood sugars. I plan on making these again very (VERY!) soon, and next time I would make a double batch, because they didn’t last long. They were so tasty, I could easily see making them as a dessert bar and serving them to guests.
 
They do need to be kept in the fridge, which doesn’t make them as portable as pre-packaged energy bars, but you just can’t beat the fresh, homemade taste.
 

 
## Ingredientes for Bars:
- 1 cup mixed nuts and seeds, toasted* (I used 1/4 cup each walnuts, pecans, sunflower seeds and pepitas, but you can use whatever you like best)
- 1/4 cup unsweetened, shredded coconut, toasted
- 1/4 cup flax seed meal
- 1/4 cup almond butter (I make my own, but store-bought would work just fine)
- 1/4 cup coconut oil
- 1/4 cup vanilla whey protein powder
- 1/2 tsp xanthan gum
- 1 tsp agave nectar
 
## Ingredientes for Ganache:
- 2 oz unsweetened chocolate, finely chopped
- 1 1/2 tbsp butter, cut into three pieces
- 1 tbsp whipping cream
- 12-20 drops stevia extract
 

## Notes
- You can toast the nuts and seeds in the oven at 350F for 8-10 minutes, watching carefully to make sure nothing burns.
- It may help to coarsely chop the larger nuts so that the smaller seeds don’t over-brown while the nuts are still raw. 
- For the coconut, it is easier to toast in a dry skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly until it is a nice brown colour.


## Directions for bars 
1. Grease an 4×8 inch loaf pan.
2. Grind nuts and seeds in a food processor until it resembles coarse meal. 
    - It’s okay to have some larger bits as they increase the crunch factor.
3. Melt together almond butter and coconut oil and stir well. 
    - You can do this in the microwave, in a saucepan on the stove over low heat, or in a warm oven. Coconut oil melts at very low temperatures and can start to sizzle quickly, so be
careful. I melted with the oven off, in the heat that remained from toasted the nuts and seeds and it only took about 2 minutes.
4. In a medium bowl, combine all bar ingredients and mix very well to combine. Spread evenly in prepared pan and press well. 
5. Place in refrigerator and let chill until firm, 30-45 minutes.

### Directions for Ganache
1. Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter with the cream over low heat. 
2. Add in chocolate and stir quickly to melt.
3. Add in remaining tablespoon butter until ganache is smooth and thick. Off heat, stir in stevia.
4. Spread ganache over chilled bars and place in fridge until completely set, about 1 hour. Cut into 6 bars.
