## INGREDIENTS: 
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 small onion, ~1/2 cup diced
- 1 small bell pepper, ~1/2 cup diced
- 1/2- 3/4 cup broccoli, chopped small
- 1-3 cups chopped greens
- 1 1/2 cups chickpea (gram) flour
- 1 3/4 cups water
- 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon turmeric 
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 1/4-1/2 cup fresh cilantro (optional)
- dash of crushed red pepper (optional)

## METHOD:
1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Wash and chop the veggies into small pieces. Sauté the onion and garlic with 1-2 Tablespoons of water until the onions start to soften. Add the peppers and the broccoli. Continue to sauté. Add water as needed to keep the veggies from sticking to the pan. When the veggies are near desired texture, add the chopped greens. Allow the greens to cook down and then remove the veggies from the heat. 
2. In a bowl, combine the chickpea flour, cumin, paprika, black pepper, turmeric, nutritional yeast, and cilantro. Stir together and then add in the water and veggies. Stir until everything is well combined. 
3. Line a muffin pan with parchment paper or baking liners. Pour about 1/4-1/3 cup of batter into each slot. Makes about 10-14 mini quiches. 
4. Bake for 20-25 minutes, and then remove from the heat. Take the chickpea quiches out of the pan and allow to cool for a few minutes. 
5. Serve with avocado slices, low sodium salsa, and fresh fruit. Also tastes great as a breakfast sandwich. Toast whole grain bread, spread on avocado, and slice the quiches in half and line on the bread. Top with veggies and enjoy!
