# Dessert Banana Pudding
 
## Ingredients
- 2 cups unsweetened almond milk
- ¼ cup raw sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 2 ½ medium bananas
- ½ box of vegan vanilla wafers
- Cinnamon for dusting
 
## Instructions
- Heat milk in a medium saucepan over low heat, stirring to avoid scald. Mash half of a banana mixing it with a little water and then add to milk. Whisk until mixture is well combined.
- Mix cornstarch and sugar together in a small mixing bowl. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water and mix creating a paste. Whisk in to milk. Raise heat to medium-high. Stir until mixture thickens, approximately 5-7 minutes.
- Transfer pudding to a bowl and set a layer of plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding. Refrigerate to set (2-4 hours)
- For individual servings, put a thin layer of pudding in a dessert glass then layer with wafers and sliced bananas. Continue this process for 2-3 layers. For one large pudding, layer a small baking dish starting with wafers, then a layer of bananas and a layer of pudding. Repeat this process to form a second layer.
- Dust with cinnamon.
